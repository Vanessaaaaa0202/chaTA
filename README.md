# chaTA 🤖💬

**chaTA** is an AI-powered question-answering web application designed to engage users in real-time conversations. The app allows users to ask questions and receive responses from an intelligent chatbot, making it useful for quick information retrieval or conversational AI demos.

## Features 🌟

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: The chatbot responds to user input intelligently, leveraging natural language processing (NLP).
- **Real-time Chat**: Users can interact with the bot through a simple, real-time chat interface.
- **Local Chat History**: Previous chat sessions are saved using the browser's `localStorage` for easy access.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with an intuitive layout for ease of use, featuring a responsive design for both desktop and mobile users.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

To run **chaTA** on your local machine, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask** (`pip install Flask`)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional, for frontend customization)

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chaTA.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd chaTA
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    Install Flask for the backend:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

4. **Run the Flask app**:

    Start the development server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Open the app**:

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to use the chatbot.

### Project Structure 📂

- **app.py**: The main Python file that runs the Flask server and handles chatbot logic.
- **templates/index.html**: The frontend HTML file for the chat interface.
- **static/style.css**: The CSS file that styles the chat interface.
- **static/app.js**: The JavaScript file that handles client-side chat interaction and communication with the server.

### Usage

Once the server is running, you can open the app in your browser. Simply type your question in the input field and press "GO Trojan" to receive a response from the chatbot. The chat history will be displayed in real-time, and previous conversations are stored locally in your browser for easy access later.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Flask**: Backend framework to handle requests and generate chatbot responses.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the frontend interface design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles real-time user interactions and communication with the backend.
- **localStorage**: Saves chat history in the browser for future reference.

## Future Roadmap 🛣️

- **Advanced NLP Models**: Integrate more sophisticated AI models for better response accuracy.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to log in and save their chat history across devices.
- **Mobile App Version**: Develop a mobile app version of chaTA for Android and iOS.
